\section{Summary}
This report contains the results for the vulnerability scan conducted on the IP addresses listed below. The scanner performs three types of scans. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ping Scan - Determine which IP addresses of those provided are online.
    \item SYN Scan - Determine for each port on each IP address its state (open, closed, or filtered).
    \item Service Scan - For each open port, determine the service running on that port. When possible a CPE is identified, otherwise the scanner attempts to give the greatest amount of information on the service.
\end{enumerate}

After performing these three scans, the scanner queries a database of CVEs for any CPEs that it determined. If any CVEs exists for the CPEs these are reported.

\section{List of CIDRs Scanned}
What follows is a list of range of IPs (CIDRs) scanned by the scanner. In the following section, only IPs that had open ports are shown.
